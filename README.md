# ShoppingListAPI
A simple ASP Net Core API program for learning purposes.

Used as a learning experience on building a Web API. It is starting off barebones and as
a single monolith application, but will be expanding to include better design structure and
design patterns.

Eventually, will want to set this up in conjuction with learning a front-end framework to 
utilize this API.
